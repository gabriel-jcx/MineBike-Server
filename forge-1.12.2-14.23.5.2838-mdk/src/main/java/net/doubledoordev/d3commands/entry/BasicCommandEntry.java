/**
 * Uses lazy instantiation because it avoids class loading mods that may not exist.
 * Also it caches the command instance to prevent it needing to be remade every config reload. (no state loss)
 * This also helps prevent cluttering the command map/list, as MC uses both for some reason. Surely just a map would do?
 *  Side effects include: Possibility disable commands still show up in help list. (there is no command un-register)
